# SciAIMed-P1
[Visit my webpage here](https://elisabethoelmann.github.io/SciAIMed-P1/index.html#home)

The  Website is intended for setting up my own medical consultancy business. The intention is to include my coding expertise latest, when I have finished my CodeInstitute Course in Diploma in Full Stack Software Development (Common Curriculum).

This website is made up of the following sections:

1.	Home/Welcome/Introduction
2.	Services
3.	Expertise 
4.	A contact form, which people can fill in to send me an email. This contact form should also contain my mobile phone number

The business goals for this website are:

1.	To give a precise overview of the services offered
2.	Background with my expertise to show the stages of my CV, education and previous work experience.
        This can only be finalized for programming, after I have finished my CI course

The user goals for this website are:

1. For first time users (mainly people in the Biotech- and Pharmaceutical Industry), who are looking for help with their projects and therefore search for medical consultancy companies, I want to give an easy understandable overview of the services I am offering, as well as my expertise to show, that I am able to conduct these services.
2. The services section is a summary of activities, which are required across the industry to sucessfully accomplish different parts of develpment projects.
Data analysis is also mentioned here, as it is one of the key pillars for sucessful drug development in Medicine. AI has been incorporated already into the title, as it is a hot topic right now in Medicine and my intention is the be educated enough to further define specific tasks, when I have finished my CI course. A big lack for Medics is a thorough understanding of AI and data analysis and the requirements and methods behind, which is one of the reasons, for me why I have signed up to the full stack software developer course.
3. The Expertise section shows my complete education (except the full stack developer diploma), which serves as basis for my services, that I intend to offer.
4.	The contact form is a simple from page for contacting me via email, mobile phone and LinkedIn.

## UX
---
### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

The SciAiMed target users are:

•	People > 18 years old
•	Biotech and Pharmaceutical Industry  and Clinical Research employers
•	People interested in medical data anlysis

What these users would be looking for:

•	Clear, concise, easy-to-find information about services
•	Clear and concise easy to read expertise section, on which the services are based

This website will offer these options, also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. An effort was taken to not provide an overwhelming amount of information at first glance which would look less professional.
Due to ease of use, it is assumed that users will be also be viewing the site on their mobile phones and therefore creating a responsive design was important.

### **Scope**
In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features are included in this release:

• Header and menu bar, to navigate to various sections of the page
• Introduction section to outline the overall goal of the page
• Services offered
• Expertise/education section
• Contact form with options to send an email, contact me via mbile and a link to my LinkedIn profile

### **Structure**

The webpage is built with a single main page for Introduction, Services and Expertise as main contents, to allow to scroll through, but it has also has a navigation bar in the header, to be able also to jump to each section. 

Additionally the website has a separate contact form, to allow easy contact via email, mobile and or LinkedIn, which is separated from the main page/ contents. 

After the introduction, I have chosen to start with the Services section, due to the fact, that it would be of key interest for users. 

Thereafter follows a summary of my education and expertise, which is important for users to see, because it is the basis, on which I am offering my services.

I chose the following order for the information 'Home/introduction> Services> Expertise > as I felt this would allow the information to be digested in the best way. Finally the contact form is separate, because it only serves the purpose of contacting me, which is separate from the rest of the main page/contents

### **Surfaces**

The colours and pictures:
I have chosen a mixture of different light blue and black background colours to give an elegant, orderly and easily readable impression with high contrast options.
Scientific/Clinical pictures are mostly light blue, due to the nature of DNA/RNA samples, serving well for the introduction, making clear, that this is a scientific/medical company. This continues in the blue colour scheme for the services offered in pale blue (rgb(150, 193, 242))
The black background of the header, expertise section sets a nice contrast to the blue colours in the introduction and services sections. 
I used Google fonts 'EB Garamond', serif;' due to its simple and elegant design
